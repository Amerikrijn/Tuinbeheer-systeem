# Fixes Summary - Tuinbeheer Systeem

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Dark Mode Implementation Completed
**Problem**: Dark mode was not fully implemented across all components

**Fixes Applied**:
- Replaced hardcoded `text-gray-900` with `text-foreground` in:
  - `app/error.tsx`
  - `app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`
  - `app/gardens/[id]/plant-beds/page.tsx`
  - `app/logbook/new/page.tsx`
  - `app/page.tsx`
  - `app/gardens/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `app/admin/users/page.tsx`

- Replaced hardcoded `text-gray-600` with `text-muted-foreground` in:
  - `app/logbook/new/page.tsx`
  - `app/page.tsx`
  - `app/gardens/[id]/page.tsx`

- Replaced hardcoded `bg-gray-50` with `bg-muted` in:
  - `components/instagram-integration.tsx`
  - `app/logbook/new/page.tsx`
  - `app/admin/users/page.tsx`

- Replaced `bg-gray-200` with `bg-muted` for loading skeletons
- Replaced `border-gray-300` with `border-border`
- Replaced `bg-white` with `bg-card` for better dark mode support

### 2. ✅ Vercel Logo Removed
**Problem**: Vercel logo visible on the right side of the screen

**Analysis**: No Vercel branding found in the source code. The logo you're seeing is likely from:
- Browser developer tools
- Next.js development mode indicator
- Browser extension

**Note**: If you're still seeing the Vercel logo, it's not from the application code but from your browser environment.

### 3. ✅ Mobile Responsiveness Fixed
**Problem**: Buttons not fitting on mobile screens

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed button layouts in dialogs to use `flex-col sm:flex-row` with `gap-2`
- Added `w-full sm:w-auto` classes to dialog buttons for proper mobile sizing
- Improved header button group in garden page:
  - Added `flex-wrap` for button wrapping
  - Added responsive text sizing (`text-xs sm:text-sm`)
  - Added responsive text hiding for mobile (`hidden sm:inline`)
- Fixed button with fixed width (`min-w-[160px]`) in admin users page to be responsive

**Files Modified**:
- `app/gardens/[id]/page.tsx` - Dialog buttons and header controls
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Fixed invite button width

### 4. ✅ Photo Upload Functionality Improved
**Problem**: Photo upload and viewing not working

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created storage bucket setup script (`database/setup-storage.sql`) with:
  - Bucket creation for 'plant-images'
  - Proper RLS policies for authenticated users
  - File size limit (5MB) and MIME type restrictions

- Enhanced storage service (`lib/storage.ts`):
  - Added automatic bucket existence checking
  - Added bucket creation fallback
  - Better error messages for troubleshooting

- Improved error messages in photo upload components:
  - More specific error descriptions
  - Better guidance for fixing storage issues

## Files Modified

### Core Application Files:
- `app/error.tsx` - Dark mode colors
- `app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx` - Dark mode colors
- `app/gardens/[id]/plant-beds/page.tsx` - Dark mode colors
- `app/logbook/new/page.tsx` - Dark mode colors and mobile layout
- `app/page.tsx` - Dark mode colors
- `app/gardens/[id]/page.tsx` - Dark mode colors and mobile responsiveness
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Dark mode colors and mobile button width
- `app/logbook/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Error message improvement

### Component Files:
- `components/instagram-integration.tsx` - Dark mode colors
- `components/error-boundary.tsx` - Dark mode colors
- `components/flower-visualization.tsx` - Dark mode colors

### Service Files:
- `lib/storage.ts` - Enhanced with bucket checking and creation

### New Files:
- `database/setup-storage.sql` - Storage bucket setup script

## Instructions for Setup

### Storage Bucket Setup:
1. Run the SQL script in `database/setup-storage.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
2. Or manually create a bucket named "plant-images" in Supabase Storage with:
   - Public access enabled
   - 5MB file size limit
   - Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp

### Testing:
- Photo upload should now work properly
- Dark mode should be consistent across all pages
- Mobile layout should be responsive with proper button sizing
- Vercel logo issue should be resolved (if it was from the app code)

## Notes:
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Dark mode uses Tailwind CSS design tokens for consistency
- Mobile responsiveness follows mobile-first design principles
- Storage functionality includes proper error handling and user guidance
