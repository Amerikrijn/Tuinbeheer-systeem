## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Shared Package (`@tuinbeheer/shared`)
All business logic is centralized:

```typescript
// Types are shared between platforms
export interface Garden {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  location: string;
  length?: string;
  width?: string;
  // ... more fields
}

// Services work on both web and mobile
export const getGardens = async (): Promise<Garden[]> => {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('gardens')
    .select('*')
    .eq('is_active', true);
  return data || [];
}
```

### Web App Usage
```typescript
// In Next.js components
import { getGardens, type Garden } from '@tuinbeheer/shared';

export default function GardensPage() {
  const [gardens, setGardens] = useState<Garden[]>([]);
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### Mobile App Usage
```typescript
// In React Native screens
import { getGardens, type Garden } from '@tuinbeheer/shared';

export default function GardensScreen() {
  const [gardens, setGardens] = useState<Garden[]>([]);
  // ... same logic, different UI
}
```

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Enhancements

### Visual Garden Designer (Mobile)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Quick Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup-cross-platform.sh

# Or manual setup
npm install
npm run shared:build
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Update these files with your Supabase credentials:
- `apps/web/.env.local`
- `apps/mobile/.env.local`

### 3. Start Development
```bash
# Start both web and mobile
./launch-all.sh

# Or start individually
./launch-web.sh     # Web only
./launch-mobile.sh  # Mobile only
```

### 4. Test on Devices
- **Web**: Open http://localhost:3000
- **Mobile**: Scan QR code with Expo Go app
- **iOS Simulator**: Press 'i' in Expo CLI
- **Android Emulator**: Press 'a' in Expo CLI
