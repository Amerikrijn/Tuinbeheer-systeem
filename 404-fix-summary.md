# 404 Error Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. 404 Error when clicking "Beheer Bloemen" button

**Problem**: The "Beheer Bloemen" button was linking to `/plant-beds/FRONT-A1/edit` which resulted in a 404 error because:
- The edit route exists at `/admin/plant-beds/[id]/edit`, not `/plant-beds/[id]/edit`
- The plant beds detail page was using mock data while the gardens page was using database data

**Solutions Applied**:

1. **Fixed the edit route link** in `app/gardens/[id]/page.tsx`:
   - Changed from `/plant-beds/${bed.id}/edit` to `/admin/plant-beds/${bed.id}/edit`

2. **Updated plant beds detail page** in `app/plant-beds/[id]/page.tsx` to use database data:
   - Replaced `getMockPlantBeds` import with `getPlantBed` from `@/lib/database`
   - Updated type from `PlantBed` to `PlantBedWithPlants`
   - Modified the useEffect to use the database function instead of mock data

### 2. CSS Warning about `-moz-column-count`

**Problem**: Browser warning about `-moz-column-count` not being supported and suggesting to add `column-count` for better browser compatibility.

**Analysis**: 
- The CSS warning appears to be coming from a third-party library or generated CSS
- No explicit `-moz-column-count` usage was found in the project's CSS files
- This is likely a browser developer tools warning about vendor-specific CSS

**Recommendation**: 
- Monitor if this warning affects functionality
- If it becomes problematic, investigate which component/library is generating the CSS
- Consider adding the standard `column-count` property alongside the vendor-specific one

## Files Modified

1. `app/gardens/[id]/page.tsx` - Fixed edit route link
2. `app/plant-beds/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated to use database instead of mock data

## Testing

Start the development server with `npm run dev` and test:
1. Navigate to a garden page
2. Click "Beheer Bloemen" button - should now navigate to the correct plant bed page
3. Click "Bewerken" button - should now navigate to the admin edit page

The 404 error should be resolved, and the plant bed details should load from the database.
