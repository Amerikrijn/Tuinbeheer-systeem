# üìã DATABASE BACKLOG

## üö® PHASE 1: STABILIZATION (COMPLETED - PRIORITY 1)
- [x] Create stabilization script (`phase1-stabilize-rls.sql`)
- [x] Create test script (`test-basic-access.sql`)
- [x] Create instructions (`PHASE1_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
- [x] **EXECUTE: Run stabilization script in Supabase**
- [x] **EXECUTE: Verify with test script**
- [x] **EXECUTE: Test application functionality**
- [x] **RESULT: Database access now consistent - no more "sometimes works, sometimes doesn't"**

## üîç PHASE 2: ANALYSIS & PLANNING (PRIORITY 2 - Next Week)
- [ ] **Database Audit**
  - [ ] Identify all existing tables and their current state
  - [ ] Document current RLS policies (if any remain)
  - [ ] Analyze which tables actually need security
  - [ ] Check for any broken foreign key relationships
  
- [ ] **Security Requirements Analysis**
  - [ ] Determine what level of security is actually needed
  - [ ] Review if banking-grade security is overkill for this use case
  - [ ] Define user roles and permissions needed
  - [ ] Plan data access patterns (who can see/edit what)
  
- [ ] **Policy Strategy Planning**
  - [ ] Design simple, working policies
  - [ ] Plan policy testing strategy
  - [ ] Document policy requirements
  - [ ] Create policy implementation plan

## üßπ DATABASE CLEANUP (PARKED - LOWER PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Table Analysis**
  - [ ] Compare preview vs production table counts (36 vs 27)
  - [ ] Identify which 17 _copy tables can be safely removed
  - [ ] Check which tables are empty vs contain data
  - [ ] Analyze if table differences are normal or problematic
  
- [ ] **Cleanup Strategy**
  - [ ] Create safe cleanup plan for _copy tables
  - [ ] Test cleanup in development first
  - [ ] Document which tables are safe to remove
  - [ ] Plan migration strategy if needed

  - [ ] Plan production deployment strategy
  - [ ] Create rollback plan
  - [ ] Schedule maintenance window
  
- [ ] **Production Implementation**
  - [ ] Deploy policies to production
  - [ ] Monitor for issues
  - [ ] Verify all functionality works
  
- [ ] **Post-Deployment**
  - [ ] Monitor system performance
  - [ ] Gather user feedback
  - [ ] Plan future security improvements

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT & IMPROVEMENTS

- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting**
  - [ ] Set up database performance monitoring
  - [ ] Add alerts for failed operations
  - [ ] Monitor policy performance impact

## üìö DOCUMENTATION NEEDS
- [ ] **User Guides**
  - [ ] Database setup guide for developers
  - [ ] Policy management guide for admins
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues
  
- [ ] **Technical Documentation**
  - [ ] Database schema documentation
  - [ ] Policy architecture documentation
  - [ ] Security implementation guide

## üß™ TESTING NEEDS
- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Test all database operations
  - [ ] Test policy enforcement
  - [ ] Test error scenarios
