# ðŸš« REMOVED: AI-Powered CodeQL Security Analysis
# 
# This workflow has been removed as part of the transition to traditional banking tests.
# 
# Reason: AI-powered security analysis does not meet traditional banking standards.
# 
# Replaced by: Traditional security audit in banking-tests.yml
# 
# Date removed: 2025-08-22
# 
# Traditional banking approach:
# - Manual code review
# - Static analysis tools
# - Security best practices
# - No AI dependencies
