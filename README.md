# ðŸŒ¿ Tuinbeheer Systeem (Garden Management System)

A comprehensive garden management system built with Next.js and Supabase, featuring visual garden design capabilities.

## ðŸš¨ Installation Issues Resolved

The installation scripts were failing due to missing Supabase CLI. We've provided multiple solutions:

### Quick Fix (Recommended)
1. **Manual SQL Import**: Copy the SQL content directly to Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Use the helper script**: `./copy-sql-setup.sh` to get the SQL content
3. **Follow the guide**: See `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions

### Alternative Solutions
- Install Supabase CLI using various methods (see guide)
- Use the simplified setup scripts for better reliability
- Run individual migration files if needed

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Database Setup**: Use the manual SQL import method
2. **Frontend**: Run `npm install && npm run dev`
3. **Configuration**: Set up your Supabase environment variables

See `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` for complete setup instructions.

## Breaking changes

We follow semantic versioning for changes that directly impact CLI commands, flags, and configurations.

However, due to dependencies on other service images, we cannot guarantee that schema migrations, seed.sql, and generated types will always work for the same CLI major version. If you need such guarantees, we encourage you to pin a specific version of CLI in package.json.

## Developing

To run from source:

```sh
# Go >= 1.22
go run . help
```
