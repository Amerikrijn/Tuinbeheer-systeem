# Toast Notifications Removal Summary

## ✅ All Toast Notifications Removed

All toast notifications that appeared in the bottom-right corner have been completely removed from the plantvak system.

### Files Modified:

1. **`app/gardens/[id]/plantvak-view/[bedId]/page.tsx`**
   - Removed `useToast` import
   - Removed `toast` hook initialization
   - Removed all toast notifications including:
     - Flower movement feedback
     - Flower selection feedback
     - Flower resize feedback
     - Flower addition/removal notifications
     - Auto-save confirmations
     - Error messages (kept only console.error for debugging)

2. **`app/gardens/[id]/page.tsx`**

   - Removed `toast` hook initialization
   - Removed all toast notifications including:
     - Plantvak movement feedback
     - Plantvak rotation feedback
     - Auto-save confirmations
     - Selection feedback

### Additional Fixes:

3. **Removed FlowerVisualization Component**
   - Removed duplicate FlowerVisualization component from plantvak view
   - This was causing duplicate flowers to appear
   - Now only using the interactive overlay for flower display

### Result:

- ✅ No more toast notifications appearing in bottom-right corner
- ✅ No duplicate flowers in plantvak view
- ✅ Clean interface without distracting popup messages
- ✅ All functionality still works (movement, rotation, saving)
- ✅ Error handling still works via console.error for debugging

The plantvak system now provides a clean, distraction-free experience while maintaining all functionality.
