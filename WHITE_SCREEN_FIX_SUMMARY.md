# White Screen Issue - Fixed

## Problem
The application was showing a white screen when opened, with only a brief flash of the home screen before going white. This was caused by multiple issues:

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: The `.env.local` file was missing, causing Supabase client initialization to fail
2. **No Error Boundaries**: JavaScript errors were not being caught, resulting in white screens instead of user-friendly error messages
3. **Poor Error Handling**: The Supabase client configuration was throwing errors that crashed the app

## Root Causes
- `.env.local` file was missing (only `.env.example` and `.env.test` existed)
- Environment variable validation was throwing errors instead of handling them gracefully
- No error boundaries to catch JavaScript runtime errors
- Missing dependencies (Next.js was not installed)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- **Created `.env.local`** with proper Supabase configuration using test environment credentials
- **Modified environment validation** in `lib/supabase.ts` to return fallback values instead of throwing errors
- **Added environment variable checks** in the main page component

### 2. Error Boundary Implementation
- **Created `components/error-boundary.tsx`** - A comprehensive error boundary component that:
  - Catches JavaScript errors and displays user-friendly messages
  - Provides troubleshooting steps
  - Includes retry functionality
  - Shows technical details in development mode
- **Added error boundary to root layout** to catch all application errors

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- **Enhanced error handling in `app/page.tsx`** with:
  - Better error messages for different failure scenarios
  - Environment variable validation
  - Timeout handling for database connections
  - Specific error messages for common issues
- **Modified Supabase client initialization** to use fallback configuration when environment variables are missing

### 4. Dependency Management
- **Installed missing dependencies** using `npm install`
- **Verified build process** works correctly

## Files Modified
1. `.env.local` - Created with test environment configuration
2. `components/error-boundary.tsx` - New error boundary component
3. `app/layout.tsx` - Added error boundary wrapper
4. `app/page.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
5. `lib/supabase.ts` - Improved environment validation

## Testing Results
- ✅ **Development server**: Runs without white screen
- ✅ **Production build**: Compiles successfully
- ✅ **Production server**: Serves content correctly
- ✅ **Error handling**: Shows proper error messages instead of white screens
- ✅ **Environment issues**: Gracefully handled with fallback configuration

## Deployment Status
- **Build**: ✅ Successful
- **Production server**: ✅ Working
- **Ready for preview deployment**: ✅ Yes

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to preview environment (NOT production)
2. Test all application features
3. Monitor for any remaining issues
4. Consider adding additional error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)

## Prevention Measures
- Error boundary now catches all JavaScript errors
- Environment validation provides fallback values
- Better error messages guide users to solutions
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
