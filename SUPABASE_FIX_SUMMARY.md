## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### New Files Created:
- `components/auth/auth-error-handler.tsx` - Smart error handling component
- `app/api/system/health/route.ts` - System health monitoring
- `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive setup instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Immediate fix steps
- `.env.local` - Local development template

### Files Enhanced:
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Better admin client handling
- `hooks/use-supabase-auth.ts` - Improved timeouts and error handling  
- `lib/config.ts` - Enhanced configuration validation
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Integrated error handler

## 🚀 Immediate Action Required

**You still need to configure these environment variables in your deployment platform:**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTECTED_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@tuinbeheer.nl
```

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Configure environment variables** (see `DEPLOYMENT_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
2. **Redeploy your application**
3. **Check system health**: Visit `/api/system/health`
4. **Test login**: Try logging in with valid credentials
5. **Monitor console**: Should see "🔒 Security validation" messages
